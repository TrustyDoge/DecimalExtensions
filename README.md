# DecimalExtensions
Some handy ExtensionMethods for numbers of type decimal.

Since the decimal type is the hero of precise math, but has not gotten enough attention, I had to add the missing functions myself.

- Get the DecimalPrecision (0.01 has a precision of 2)
- Rounding numbers up or down with any precision.

No license. Do with it whatever you want. Happy mathing.
